Giants to Consider:
race bases
troll
demon flayer
flesh golem or flesh-eating ghoul
battle source puppet
hungry flower
harbinger of doom? (bad for groundsmash)
voidwoken bonecrusher? (kinda messed up groundsmash)
	bone destroyer same deal
void flayer
voidwoken deep-dweller (weird movement)
drill worm maybe
werewolf?


Messed Up Explosions:
when you did turtles, did you get story turtles as well?
(ghost deer) ((huh? l guess l wanted to double-check GM ghost deer))
battle source puppet has a tree squish, so the moppet
why is lv6 poisonous trunk not Vegetal? why does lv5 not have poison touch?
	why does lv5 squish into guts? also, trunk has medium tree, puppet has small
spiky trunk & hungry flower have wrong squish, too
nightmarish voidwoken has a huge bug squish! give to ancient matriarch, cold-crawler,
	necro-wing, voidwoken spider, forest spider
void flayer & vw bonecrusher look like they're made of rock, but I guess they bleed?
deep dweller could squish into the medium black blood
all those voidlings should squish into the medium bug guts forest beetle has
	and dune spider, cursed spider, dune beetle, fire slug
bone crawler needs bone squish. and bone walker, bone widow
kedelonthebonecrusher has unique squish, but not its generic sibling bone destroyer?????
	prolly shouldn't be in his own category, too
undead scarecrow should get tree
the incandescent skeletons are supposed to squish into bone!
