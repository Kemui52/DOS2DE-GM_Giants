# DOS2 Giants Mod

Adds various overpowered giant monsters to Game Master mode for personal enjoyment. Not intended for typical GM use, but l guess no one's stopping you. Oh yeah, and made on the Definitive Edition.

***Spoiler Warning!*** Mod adds and will add story spoiler characters and creatures to the character list.

Since I made this mod for myself, the giants I add are solely based on my own tastes. Check the [wiki](https://github.com/Kemui52/DOS2DE-GM_Giants/wiki) for more detailed info on what's included, as well as what each mod does.

Check my [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2778577565) or the [Releases](https://github.com/Kemui52/DOS2DE-GM_Giants/releases) page for proper package downloads. The Workshop will typically be more up to date because that one's the easiest to upload to, but it can vary based on how important l think the changes are.

## How to Install Modkit Source

You should be able to install a mod's source to your modding kit by copying its Editor, Mods, Projects, and Public folders into the following game directory:

``.\Divinity Original Sin 2\DefEd\Data\``

I assume so, anyway. Dunno if anything else is needed.

## How to Install Local Release

Release paks should be placed in:

``.\Documents\Larian Studios\Divinity Original Sin 2 Definitive Edition\Local Mods\``

Or at least, I would assume that's all you need to do. As for the load order, the main Kemui GM Mod always goes above my other mods. More detailed info can be found on the wiki home page.
