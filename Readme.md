# DOS2 Giants Mod

Adds various overpowered giant monsters to Game Master mode for personal enjoyment. Not intended for typical GM use, but l guess no one's stopping you. Oh yeah, and made on the Definitive Edition.

**Spoiler Warning!** Mod adds and will add story spoiler characters and creatures to the character list.

I should add a wiki here to list what's been added.

Check the [Releases](https://github.com/Kemui52/DOS2DE-GM_Giants/releases) page or my [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2778577565) for proper package downloads. Neither are more up to date than the other, though I am holding back on furnishing the Worksop so it doesn't get too much attention while it's new.

## How to Install Source

You should be able to install a mod's source to your modding kit by copying its Editor, Mods, Projects, and Public folders into the following game directory:

``.\Divinity Original Sin 2\DefEd\Data\``

I assume so, anyway. Dunno if anything else is needed.

## How to Install Release

Release paks should be placed in:

``.\Documents\Larian Studios\Divinity Original Sin 2 Definitive Edition\Local Mods\``

I would assume that's all you need to do.

## Overrides

Care was taken to remove unecessary overrides in the stats, but others are still present for one reason or another.

The two Game Master dragon RootTemplates, because I can't undo RootTemplate overrides.

The All-In skill, because I thought I was using it but I changed my mind. I'll prolly remove this.

All versions of Overpower, because I hated how desync'd its original audio was.

Many, many creature RootTemplates for GM and Story, because I'm fixing all the erroneous explosion models.

Slane's VisualSet, because I figured it wouldn't hurt anything to add stuff to the end. I doubt it does, but I'll prolly fix this because I don't need to.
