# DOS2 Giants Mod

Adds various overpowered giant monsters to Game Master mode for personal enjoyment. Not intended for typical GM use, but l guess no one's stopping you.

Check releases page or Steam Workshop for proper package downloads.

## How to Install Source

You should be able to install the source to a mod by copying its Editor, Mods, Projects, and Public folders into your ``.\Divinity Original Sin 2\DefEd\Data\`` directory. I assume so, anyway. Dunno if that's how it works.

### Overrides

Care was taken to remove unecessary overrides in the stats, but some are still present.

The two Game Master dragon RootTemplates, because I can't undo RootTemplate overrides.

The All-In skill, because I thought I was using it but I changed my mind. I'll prolly remove this.

All versions of Overpower, because I hated how desync'd its original audio was.

Many, many creature RootTemplates for GM and Story, because I'm fixing all the erroneous explosion models.

Slane's VisualSet, because I figured it wouldn't hurt anything to add stuff to the end. I doubt it does, but I'll prolly fix this because I don't need to.
