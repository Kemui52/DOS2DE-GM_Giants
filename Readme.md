# DOS2 Giants Mod

Adds various overpowered giant monsters to Game Master mode for personal enjoyment. Not intended for typical GM use, but l guess no one's stopping you. Oh yeah, and made on the Definitive Edition.

***Spoiler Warning!*** Mod adds and will add story spoiler characters and creatures to the character list.

Since I made this mod for myself, the giants I add are solely based on my own tastes. Check the [wiki](https://github.com/Kemui52/DOS2DE-GM_Giants/wiki) for more detailed info on what's included.

Check my [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2778577565) or the [Releases](https://github.com/Kemui52/DOS2DE-GM_Giants/releases) page for proper package downloads. Neither are more up to date than the other, though I am holding back on furnishing the Worksop so it doesn't get too much attention while it's new.

## How to Install Source

You should be able to install a mod's source to your modding kit by copying its Editor, Mods, Projects, and Public folders into the following game directory:

``.\Divinity Original Sin 2\DefEd\Data\``

I assume so, anyway. Dunno if anything else is needed.

## How to Install Release

Release paks should be placed in:

``.\Documents\Larian Studios\Divinity Original Sin 2 Definitive Edition\Local Mods\``

Or at least, I would assume that's all you need to do. The file size is suspiciously small compared to the Workshop listing.

## Other Info
